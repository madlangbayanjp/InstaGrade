# InstaGrade: An Automated Grading Scanner Using Text Recognition

InstaGrade is developed using Flutter (Dart) and is a final project for our mobile application course. This project helps teachers efficiently grade students' identification answers just by scanning them into the students' answer sheets. This project aims to reduce the workload of our teachers and simplify the grading of each student's papers.
